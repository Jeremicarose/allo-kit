# Allo Simple Grants

[AlloKit Builders Telegram Group](https://t.me/+JUT-LKVo13dlN2Rh)

AlloKit is a modular framework for rapidly building and experimenting with on-chain funding strategies.
It is built on top of **[Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2)** and inspired by **[OpenZeppelinâ€™s](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/)** design principles of modularity, extensibility, and reuse.

### Key features

- [Components](https://allo-kit-docs.vercel.app/allo-app/components) built with **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)**.
- [Indexer](https://allo-kit-docs.vercel.app/indexer) built with **[Ponder](https://ponder.sh)**
- [Strategy Contracts](https://allo-kit-docs.vercel.app/contracts) built with **[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com)**
- Hooks generated by **[Wagmi CLI](https://wagmi.sh/cli/getting-started)**

## Architecture

This document outlines the thought process of building SimpleGrants and AlloKit.

### Contracts

The contracts are designed to be minimal and modular. A Strategy contract can easily be created by composing extensions and gates.

### Indexer

The indexer is built with Ponder and can be easily extended to support new events.

## Getting Started

### Update .env variables

Create `.env.local` files for both the allo app and the indexer.

```sh
cp packages/allo-app/.env.sample packages/allo-app/.env.local
cp packages/allo-indexer/.env.sample packages/allo-indexer/.env.local
```

Update the Pinata variables. This is needed for the creation and fetching of metadata to work properly.

```sh
PINATA_GATEWAY_KEY=
PINATA_JWT=
PINATA_GATEWAY_URL=
```

Update the Alchemy key. This is needed to fetch the token price in USD.

```sh
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=
```

### Development

```sh
yarn chain          # Run hardhat node
yarn deploy         # Deploy contracts
yarn allo:indexer   # Run indexer
yarn allo:dev       # Run app
yarn app            # Run contract debugger

open localhost:3000
```

Make sure Ponder schema has been generated. Regenerate by navigating to `packages/allo-indexer` and run `npm run codegen`.
