# Direct Grants

In this tutorial, we'll create a Direct Grants strategy that allows an admin to grant funds to a list of recipients. The main features are:

- **Project Registration**: Grantees register their projects.
- **Application Listing**: Admins list the submitted project applications.
- **Application Approval**: Admins review and approve each application.
- **Token Allocation**: Approved projects are displayed with an input field to enter the grant amount.

AlloKit makes it easy to build such strategies by providing smart contract extensions and pre-built React components.

<Callout type="info">
  AlloKit standardizes functions like `allocate` across strategies, which means
  the same interface is used everywhereâ€”making it straightforward for indexing.
</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
  Notice that many functions (like `allocate` and `register`) include a `data`
  parameter that allows you to pass custom information. This parameter can be
  used to add custom functionality that may be useful for your allocation logic
  or for off-chain indexing.

## Smart contract

### Understanding the Contract Structure

A DirectGrants strategy would extend the base Pool contract. While not included in the current codebase, here's how you would create one following the same patterns as QuadraticFunding.

### Creating a DirectGrants Contract

Create a new file at `packages/hardhat/contracts/strategies/DirectGrants.sol` following the Pool-based architecture:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import {ReentrancyGuard} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import {Context} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol";
import {AccessControl} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
import {Pool, PoolConfig} from "../Pool.sol";

contract DirectGrants is Pool, Context, AccessControl, ReentrancyGuard {
    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _schema, string memory _metadataURI)
        Pool(_name, _schema, _metadataURI) {}

    function initialize(PoolConfig memory _config, bytes memory data) public override {
        super.initialize(_config, data);
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _config.owner);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _config.admins.length; i++) {
            _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _config.admins[i]);
        }
    }

    // Configure pool (admin only)
    function configure(PoolConfig memory _config) public override onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        super._configure(_config);
    }

    // Anyone can register a project
    function register(address project, string memory _metadataURI, bytes memory data) external override {
        _register(project, _metadataURI, data);
    }

    // Only admins can review applications
    function review(address project, uint8 status, string memory _metadataURI, bytes memory data)
        external override onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        _review(project, status, _metadataURI, data);
    }

    // Only admins can allocate grants
    function allocate(address[] memory recipients, uint256[] memory amounts, address token, bytes[] memory data)
        external override onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) nonReentrant {
        require(token == config.allocationToken, "Must use allocation token");
        _allocate(recipients, amounts, token, data);
    }

    // Validation: only approved projects can receive grants
    function _beforeAllocate(address recipient, uint256 amount, address token, bytes memory data) internal override {
        require(registrations[recipient].status == Status.approved, "Recipient must be approved");
    }
}
```

### Key Differences from QuadraticFunding

1. **Admin-Only Allocation**: Only admins can allocate grants (vs. open donations in QF)
2. **Simpler Logic**: Straightforward approval -> allocation workflow

### Pool Configuration

The DirectGrants strategy uses the PoolConfig structure:

```solidity
struct PoolConfig {
    address owner;            // Pool owner
    address[] admins;         // Additional admins who can review/allocate
    address allocationToken;  // Token used for grant allocations
    address distributionToken; // Token used for distributions (often same as allocation)
    uint256 maxAmount;        // Maximum pool funding (0 = no limit)
    uint64[] timestamps;      // Important dates
    string metadataURI;       // Pool metadata
}
```

### Registration and Review Process

1. **Registration**: Projects call `register()` with their metadata
2. **Review**: Admins call `review()` to approve/reject applications
3. **Allocation**: Admins can allocate grants to approved projects
4. **Distribution**: Pool can distribute funds directly to recipients

### Deploying the contract

Open the deploy script at `packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.ts` and add the new contract:

```ts
await deploy("DirectGrants", {
  from: deployer,
  args: [
    "DirectGrants", // Pool name
    "()", // Schema (empty for basic usage)
    "ipfs metadata cid", // Pool metadata URI
  ],
  log: true,
  autoMine: true,
});
```

## Frontend

AlloKit provides React components and hooks to interact with your contract. We will create pages for project registration, listing applications, browsing approved projects, and allocating tokens.

### Register Project

Create a new page at `app/project/register/page.tsx`. This page uses the `RegistrationForm` component along with the `useContracts` hook to access the deployed `DirectGrants` contract.

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { useContracts } from "~/hooks/use-contracts";
import { RegistrationForm } from "~/components/registration/registration-form";

export default function RegisterProjectPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { DirectGrants } = useContracts();
  return (
    <RegistrationForm
      strategyAddress={DirectGrants?.address}
      onSuccess={({ project }) => router.push(`/project/${project}`)}
    />
  );
}
```

Visiting http://localhost:3000/projects/register should display the registration form. You can modify the form inputs by editing `packages/allo-app/components/registration/registration-form.tsx`.

### List Applications

Create a page at `app/application/page.tsx` to list project applications that have not yet been approved.

```tsx
import { useContracts } from "~/hooks/use-contracts";
import { ApplicationsList } from "~/components/registration/applications-list";

export default function ApplicationsPage() {
  const { DirectGrants } = useContracts();
  return (
    <ApplicationsList
      query={{
        where: {
          // Include applications for DirectGrants strategy
          strategy_in: [DirectGrants?.address],
          isApproved: false, // Only show unapproved applications
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

Opening http://localhost:3000/applications should display a list of unapproved applications with a button to approve them.

### Browse Projects

Create a page at `app/project/page.tsx` to display a grid of approved projects. Projects can be added to a cart that will persist across page navigation and reloads.

<Callout>
  Note that both the `ProjectsList` and `ApplicationsList` components use the
  same `Grid` component with the `useRegistrations` hook. This
  shared functionality helps maintain consistency in how project data is fetched
  and displayed. You can open these components to see how they are implemented.

</Callout>

```tsx
import { useContracts } from "~/hooks/use-contracts";
import { ProjectsList } from "~/components/registration/projects-list";

export default function BrowseProjectsPage() {
  const { DirectGrants } = useContracts();
  return (
    <ProjectsList
      query={{
        where: {
          strategy_in: [DirectGrants?.address],
          isApproved: true, // Only show projects that are approved
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

Navigating to http://localhost:3000/project should display a grid of approved projects.

### Allocation Page

Next we want to allocate tokens to the projects we have added to our cart. Create a new page: `app/checkout/page.tsx`.

The `AllocationForm` component renders the Projects we have added to our cart and allows us to allocate tokens to them.

On local development, we deploy an ERC20Mock token to make it easy to test Allo Apps. We can use the `MintTokens` component to mint tokens to the address of the wallet we're connected with.

```tsx
import { useContracts } from "~/hooks/use-contracts";
import { AllocationForm } from "~/components/allocation/allocation-form";
import { MintTokens } from "~/components/mint-tokens";

export default function CheckoutPage() {
  const { DirectGrants, ERC20Mock } = useContracts();
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <AllocationForm
        strategyAddress={DirectGrants?.address}
        tokenAddress={ERC20Mock?.address}
      />
      <MintTokens tokenAddress={ERC20Mock?.address} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Next Steps

After completing the basics, consider the following improvements:

- **Access Control**: The current implementation uses AccessControl for granular permissions on who can approve projects and allocate funds.
- **Admin-Only Views**: Limit the `ApplicationsPage` so that only admins can view the applications.
- **Pool Factory**: Use the PoolFactory to deploy new DirectGrants instances dynamically.
- **Advanced Features**: Add features like milestones, reporting requirements, or multi-sig approvals.
