# Quadratic Funding

This tutorial builds on the [Direct Grants](/tutorials/direct-grants) tutorial. These are the changes and additions we will make:

- Contract is deployed with a specified donation and matching token
- Matching funds can be added that will be distributed to projects based on quadratic funding calculation
- Donations can be made by anyone to projects with the donation token
- Distribution of matching funds to projects (only by owner)
- Add a Distribute page to add matching funds and distribute them to projects

It will have the following features:

- **Distribute Page**: Add a page to distribute matching funds to projects.
- **Add Matching Funds**: Add a way to add and withdraw matching funds from the strategy.
- **Calculate Matching Funds**: Calculate the matching funds for each project based on the donation amount.
- **List Project Allocations**: List the allocations for each project.
- **Distribute Matching Funds**: Add a way to distribute matching funds to projects.

## Smart contract

### Create the Contract File

Create a new file at `packages/hardhat/contracts/QuandraticFunding.sol`.

### Donation and Matching Tokens

We want to allow donations of a specific token to be allocated to projects.
We will then use these donations to calculate a quadratic funding amount for each project to be awarded from the matching pool.

As described in the [Allocator](/contracts/allocator) documentation:

- **Allocate** - tokens going from sender to a recipient. We will use this for donations and funding the matching pool.
- **Distribute** - tokens going from strategy contract to a recipient. This is for distributing the matching funds to projects.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;

import { Ownable } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

import { Allocator } from "../extensions/Allocator.sol";
import { Registry, IRegistry } from "../extensions/Registry.sol";
import { Strategy } from "../base/Strategy.sol";

contract QuadraticFunding is Strategy, Allocator, Registry, Ownable {
    address public immutable donationToken;
    address public immutable matchingToken;

    constructor(
        address owner,
        address _donationToken,
        address _matchingToken
    ) Ownable(owner) Strategy("QuadraticFunding") {
        donationToken = _donationToken;
        matchingToken = _matchingToken;
    }

    // Register is inherited from the Registry contract so we don't need to override it

    // Owner can approve projects
    function approve(
        address project,
        uint256 index,
        string memory metadataURI,
        bytes memory data
    ) public override onlyOwner {
        super.approve(project, index, metadataURI, data);
    }

    // Override allocate function to check if tokens are either donation or matching
    function _allocate(address to, uint256 amount, address token, bytes memory data) internal override nonReentrant {
        if (to == address(this)) require(token == matchingToken, "Matching funds to strategy must be matching token");
        if (to != address(this)) require(token == donationToken, "Allocations to projects must be donation token");

        super._allocate(to, amount, token, data);
    }

    // Distribution of matching funds to projects (must be by owner)
    function distribute(
        address[] memory recipients,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        address token,
        bytes[] memory data
    ) public override onlyOwner {
        require(token == matchingToken, "Must be matching token");
        super.distribute(recipients, amounts, token, data);
    }
}
```

### Deploying the contract

Open the deploy script at `packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.ts` and add the new contract:

For the sake of simplicity, we will use the `ERC20Mock` token for both the donation and matching tokens. We can easily mint these tokens from the UI.

```ts
const mockToken = await hre.ethers.getContract<Contract>("ERC20Mock", deployer);
const tokenAddress = await mockToken.getAddress();
await deploy("QuandraticFunding", {
  from: deployer,
  args: [
    "0xYourAdminAddress", // Replace with your wallet address
    tokenAddress, // Donation token
    tokenAddress, // Matching token
  ],
  log: true,
  autoMine: true,
});
```

## Frontend

AlloKit provides React components and hooks to interact with your contract. We will create pages for project registration, listing applications, browsing approved projects, and allocating tokens.

### Distribute Page

Create a new page at `app/distribute/page.tsx`.

```tsx
import { calculateQuadraticMatching, getContributions } from "~/lib/quadratic";

export default function DistributePage() {
  const invalidate = useInvalidate();
  const { QuandraticFunding, ERC20Mock } = useContracts();
  const strategyAddress = QuandraticFunding?.address;
  const donationToken = ERC20Mock?.address;
  const matchingTokenAddress = ERC20Mock?.address;

  // Get all donations to projects
  const allocations = useAllocations({
    where: {
      // Only fetch allocations for this strategy
      strategy_in: [strategyAddress],
      // Not any transfers to or from Strategy contract (fund / withdraw of matching)
      to_not_in: [strategyAddress],
      from_not_in: [strategyAddress],
    },
  });
  const donations = allocations.data?.items ?? [];

  const matchingToken = useToken(matchingTokenAddress, strategyAddress);
  const matchingFunds = matchingToken.data?.balance ?? BigInt(0);

  const matching = calculateQuadraticMatching(donations, matchingFunds);

  const distribute = useDistribute({ strategyAddress });

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <div className="flex justify-end">
        <DistributeButton
          strategyAddress={strategyAddress}
          tokenAddress={matchingTokenAddress}
          onSuccess={() =>
            invalidate([matchingToken.queryKey, allocations.queryKey])
          }
        />
      </div>
      <AllocationsDistributions
        strategyAddress={strategyAddress}
        tokenAddress={tokenAddress}
      />
      <MatchingFunds
        strategyAddress={strategyAddress}
        tokenAddress={tokenAddress}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Matching Funds

Add matching funds that will be used to distribute to projects.

## Next Steps

After completing the basics, consider the following improvements:

- **Access Control**: Replace the Ownable pattern with [AccessControl](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#AccessControl) to allow more granular permissions on who can approve projects and allocate funds.
- **Token Support**: Handle different ERC20 tokens for donation and matching. Perhaps add a way to add approved tokens.
