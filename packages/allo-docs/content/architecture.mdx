# Architecture

The AlloKit architecture is centered around a Pool contract.
This Pool contract is intended to be as minimal and expressive as possible and to cover as many use-cases as possible.

This contract does the following:

- registering and updating of applications with metadata
- reviewing (approve, reject) of applications (with optional metadata)
- allocation of tokens from sender to addresses (voting, donations, pool funding, ...)
- distribution of tokens from pool contract to addresses (matching funds)

- centered around a Pool
  - handles registration and review of projects
  - handles token transfers to and from projects and the pool contract itself

```solidity
interface IPool {
    event Deployed(string name, address indexed owner, string schema, PoolConfig config);
    event Allocate(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount, address token, bytes data);
    event Register(address indexed project, address indexed owner, string metadataURI, bytes data);
    event Review(address indexed project, uint8 status, address indexed approver, string metadataURI, bytes data);
    event Update(address indexed project, address indexed updater, string metadataURI, bytes data);
    event Configure(address indexed updater, PoolConfig config);

    function initialize(PoolConfig memory config, bytes memory data) external;
    function _configure(address updater, PoolConfig memory config) external;
    function _register(address project, string memory metadataURI, bytes memory data) external;
    function _update(address project, string memory metadataURI, bytes memory data) external;
    function _review(address project, uint8 status, string memory metadataURI, bytes memory data) external;
    function _allocate(
        address[] memory recipients,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        address token,
        bytes[] memory data
    ) external;
    function _distribute(
        address[] memory recipients,
        uint256[] memory amounts,
        address token,
        bytes[] memory data
    ) external;
}
```

Registering a Project

- `register(projectAddress, projectMetadata)`

Reviewing a Project

- `review(poolAddress, projectAddress, status, reviewMetadata)`

Funding a Pool

- `allocate([poolAddress], [fundingAmount], token)`

Funding Projects

- `allocate([projectA, projectB], [amountA, amountB], token)`

Distributing tokens from Pool

- `distribute([projectA, projectB], [amountA, amountB], token)`

```

```
