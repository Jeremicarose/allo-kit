# AlloKit App

The AlloKit App is a Next.js 15 application for managing grant pools, project registrations, and token allocations. It provides interfaces for project owners, pool managers, and donors.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router and React 19
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **TailwindCSS 4** with Radix UI components
- **Wagmi 2.15** for Ethereum interactions
- **TanStack Query** for state management and caching
- **GraphQL** for indexer data fetching

## Core Features

#### For Project Owners
- Submit applications to grant pools
- Manage project information and metadata
- Track application status and reviews

#### For Pool Owners  
- Create and configure grant pools
- Review and approve project applications
- Manage pool funds and distributions

#### For Donors
- Browse and explore grant pools
- Discover projects within pools
- Donate to projects with cart system

## Application Structure

The app uses Next.js App Router with these main sections:

```
app/
├── app/                     # Public interfaces
│   ├── pools/              # Pool exploration and projects
│   └── profile/            # User profile management
├── dashboard/              # Pool management interfaces
│   ├── [poolAddress]/      # Pool-specific dashboard
│   └── create-pool/       # Pool creation wizard
└── api/ipfs/              # IPFS upload endpoint
```

## Data Flow

1. **Smart Contracts** emit events → **Ponder Indexer** → **GraphQL API**
2. **Frontend** queries indexer via GraphQL and interacts with contracts via Wagmi
3. **TanStack Query** provides caching and real-time updates

## Key Components

### Pool Management
- **PoolForm**: Create new grant pools
- **PoolCard**: Display pool information
- **PoolDashboard**: Administrative interface

### Project Registration
- **RegistrationForm**: Submit project applications
- **ApplicationsList**: Review and approve applications

### Token Operations
- **AllocationForm**: Donate to projects with cart
- **AllowanceCheck**: Handle token approvals
- **TokenAmount**: Format token displays

## Development Setup

Start the development environment:

```bash
yarn chain          # Start Hardhat node
yarn deploy         # Deploy contracts
yarn allo:indexer   # Start Ponder indexer
yarn allo:dev       # Start Next.js app
```

Environment setup:
- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.local`
- Configure IPFS settings (Pinata)

## Supported Chains

- **Hardhat**: Local development (chainId: 31337)
- **Base Sepolia**: Testnet (chainId: 84532)
- **Base Mainnet**: Production (chainId: 8453)
