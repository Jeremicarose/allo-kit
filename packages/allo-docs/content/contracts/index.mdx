# Strategy Contracts

A Strategy contract can easily be created by composing extensions and gates. They are inspired by OpenZeppelin's ERC20, ERC721, and the AccessControl contracts.

- **Pool** - base pool contract
- **Gates** - modifiers to restrict function calls (eg. via checking token balance, or attestations)

There are some benefits in using the same functions and events for our strategies:

- Hooks are generated by Wagmi CLI for `register`, `review`, `allocate`, and `distribute`.
- Indexer will automatically index all `Initialize`, `Register`, `Review`, `Allocate` events without us needing to make any changes to it.

This means when we're building apps we can simply re-use a handful of hooks and the indexer will index these events:

- **`useStrategies()`** - deployed strategies
- **`usePools()`** - created pools (from deployed strategies)
- **`useRegister(poolAddress)`** - register projects and applications
- **`useReview(poolAddress)`** - review (approve or reject) projects and applications
- **`useAllocate(poolAddress)`** - transfer tokens to an address (donations, funding, voting)
- **`useDistribute(poolAddress)`** - transfer tokens from the pool (matching funds, etc)
- **`useRegistrations(query)`** - query projects, applications, reviews
- **`useAllocations(query)`** - query any token transfers in relation to the pool
