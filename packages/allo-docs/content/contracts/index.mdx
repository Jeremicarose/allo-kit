# Strategy Contracts

A Strategy contract can easily be created by composing extensions and gates. They are inspired by OpenZeppelin's ERC20, ERC721, and the AccessControl contracts.

- **Strategy** - base strategy contract
- **Registry** - handles _registration_ and _approvals_ of projects and applications
- **Allocator** - handles token transfers _to_ and _from_ strategy contract
- **Gates** - modifiers to restrict function calls (eg. via checking token balance, or attestations)

There are some benefits in using the same functions and events for our strategies:

- Hooks are generated by Wagmi CLI for `register`, `approve`, `allocate`, and `distribute`.
- Indexer will automatically index all `Register`, `Approve`, `Allocate` events without us needing to make any changes to it.

This means when we're building apps we can simply re-use a handful of hooks and the indexer will index these events:

- **`useStrategies()`** - list created strategies
- **`useRegister(strategyAddress)`** - register projects and applications
- **`useApprove(strategyAddress)`** - review and approve projects and applications
- **`useAllocate(strategyAddress)`** - transfer tokens to an address (donations, funding, voting)
- **`useDistribute(strategyAddress)`** - transfer tokens from the strategy (matching funds, etc)
- **`useRegistrations(query)`** - query projects, applications, reviews
- **`useAllocations(query)`** - query any token transfers in relation to the strategy
