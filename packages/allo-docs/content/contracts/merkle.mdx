# MerkleClaim

MerkleVerify provides two internal functions that can be called from parent contract and a public claim function to transfer tokens.

```solidity
event MerkleSet(bytes32 root);
event Claim(address recipient, uint256 amount, address token);

function _setMerkle(bytes32 root) internal virtual
function _verify(bytes32 memory proof, address token, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal virtual
function claim(bytes32 memory proof, address token, address recipient, uint256 amount) public virtual
```
