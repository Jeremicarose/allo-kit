# Registry

A simple registry to handle eligibility for funding (or keeping track of project addresses for other purposes).

Metadata can be sent for both registration (Application) and approving (Review).

The first registration for an address becomes the registration for the project and the following registrations are applications.

This allows us to handle project details, applications, and reviews in one primitive.

```solidity
event Register(address indexed project, uint256 indexed index, string metadataURI, bytes data);
event Approve(address indexed project, uint256 indexed index, string metadataURI, bytes data);

enum Status {
    pending,
    approved
}

struct Registration {
    Status status;
    bytes data; // Data can contain information that can be accessed later
}

 mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => Registration)) public projects;

function _register(address recipient, string calldata metadataURI, bytes calldata data) internal virtual {}
function _approve(address recipient, string calldata metadataURI, bytes calldata data) internal virtual {}
```

##### Examples

```solidity
// Only Strategy owner can approve projects
contract ExampleStrategy is Registry, Ownable {
    function approve(address recipient, string calldata metadataURI, bytes calldata data)
        public override onlyOwner {
            _approve(recipient, metadataURI, data);
        }
}

// Auto-approve projects on registration
contract SimpleGrants is Strategy, Allocator, Registry, Ownable {
    function register(address project, string memory metadataURI, bytes memory data) public override {
        _register(project, metadataURI, data);
        _approve(project, 0, "", ""); // Auto-approve projects
    }
}

```

**Indexer GraphQL Query**

```graphql
{
    registrations({ where: { strategyAddress: 0xYourContract }}) {
        items {
            project
            index       # 0 for initial project registration, >= 1 for applications
            isApproved  # Status is updated on Approve event
            metadata    # Contains the fetched metadataURI
            review      # Contains the fetched metadataURI for the Approve event
        }
    }
}
```
