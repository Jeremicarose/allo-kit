# Introduction

AlloKit is a modular framework for rapidly building and experimenting with on-chain funding strategies.
It is built on top of **[Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2)** and inspired by **[OpenZeppelinâ€™s](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/)** design principles of modularity, extensibility, and reuse.
